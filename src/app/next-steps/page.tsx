        An experienced emergency physician will review your information
        and contact you directly to discuss your situation and help you

        The goal of this conversation is to assess urgency, clarify risk,
        and provide guidance. It is not a replacement for emergency care
        or an in-person medical evaluation.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
        If at any point your symptoms worsen or you feel unsafe, call
        911 or seek emergency care immediately.
      </p>
